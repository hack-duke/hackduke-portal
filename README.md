## Getting started
```bash
$ cp ../hackduke-secrets/.env-hackduke-portal .env  # assuming the projects share the same parent folder
$ npm install                                       # Install project dependencies
$ npm run serve                                     # Compile and launch
```

NOTE: If you are having trouble with localhost redirecting to https, please use the ip and port url instead.

Additional scripts are here:

|`npm run <script>`|Description|
|------------------|-----------|
|`serve`|Serves your app. HMR will be enabled in development.|
|`start`|Serves the app for production (called on heroku).|
|`compile`|Compiles the application to disk (`~/dist` by default).|
|`dev`|Same as `npm start`, but enables nodemon for the server as well.|
|`dev:no-debug`|Same as `npm run dev` but disables devtool instrumentation.|
|`test`|Runs unit tests with Karma and generates a coverage report.|
|`test:dev`|Runs Karma and watches for changes to re-run tests; does not generate coverage reports.|
|`deploy`|Runs linter, tests, and then, on success, compiles your application to disk.|
|`deploy:dev`|Same as `deploy` but overrides `NODE_ENV` to "development".|
|`deploy:prod`|Same as `deploy` but overrides `NODE_ENV` to "production".|
|`lint`|Lint all `.js` files.|
|`lint:fix`|Lint and fix all `.js` files. [Read more on this

##Merging changes
Make sure to squash all commits upon merge, using Github's "squash and merge" functionality. 

##Spacing
Please use 2 spaces to indent

##Deployment instructions
Currently using heroku for deployment

##Continous integration
Currently using travis CI to run the tests on every build and deploy to heroku on merges to master

##Configuration variables

If you would like to edit or add config variables, .env must be updated but two other places must be modified. The globals in `~/config/index.js`. and specified as well in `~/.eslintrc`.

## Server

This starter kit comes packaged with an Koa server. The purpose of the server is to provide `webpack-dev-middleware`, `webpack-hot-middleware` for hot module replacement, and basic auth for the server.

##Starter kit

Special thanks to davezuko, this repository is based on https://github.com/davezuko/react-redux-starter-kit. See it's README for more information.
